/**
 * Every report, as the screens know it. M19, P18.

 * The server owns every figure, label and column; this file only says which
 * screen controls a report needs, which group it sits in on the index, and the
 * one-line question from docs/REPORT-SPEC.md section 2. Roles mirror the
 * contract's permission table so the index can hide what a role cannot open;
 * the server refuses them regardless.
 *
 * `dateMode`: 'none' (R1, always today), 'date' (one business date), 'range'
 * (from and to), or 'asOf' (R17: a date the accounts are read as of, plus an
 * optional range for one account's statement).

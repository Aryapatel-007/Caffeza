/**
 * The printer this device prints to, and the page each one needs. P25 Part C.
 *
 * Pure functions only, so a server test can import this file and check them,
 * the way P01 tested the client's business date mirror.
 *
 * Why `pageCss` exists: P05 wrote `@page { size: 80mm auto }`. `auto` is not a
 * length, and `size` takes one or two lengths or a keyword, so Chrome dropped
 * the whole rule, printed on the printer's own paper (A4, or Letter in a
 * headless browser) and the receipt came out as an 80 mm strip in the top
 * left corner.
 *
 * P25 then gave a thermal page two lengths, the roll's width and the
 * receipt's measured height. On Z Chaat's Windows computer (2026-10-09) the
 * printer driver had no paper of that size, so Chrome printed on the driver's
 * own, longer paper and centred the bill on it: blank paper above and below.
 * Then a thermal page named no size, so Chrome used the driver's roll from
 * its top; but Chrome's preview, and any printer left on A4, showed the bill
 * in the corner of a whole sheet. So each device now chooses its paper length
 * (`PAPER_LENGTHS`): `BILL`, the default, a page exactly as long as the bill
 * and exactly as wide as the head prints, so the driver has nothing to centre
 * or shrink; or `ROLL`, no size, for a driver that centres a page it has no
 * paper for. docs/DEPLOYMENT.md section 10.
 *
 * `printableMm` is the width the print head reaches: 48 mm on a 58 mm roll
 * (384 dots at 203 dpi) and 72 mm on an 80 mm roll (576 dots). Laying the
 * text out to the paper's full width cut off the right-hand column.

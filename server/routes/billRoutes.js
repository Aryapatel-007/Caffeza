/**
 * Billing routes.
 *
 * Reading one bill and its receipt is open to all six roles, because a waiter
 * carries the bill to the table. Creating one and taking payment is the
 * cashier's job.
 *
 * Discounting and voiding are NOT, and that is the whole point of this module.
 * BUILD-PLAN section 7 names voids and discounts as the events an owner is
 * losing money to, so both need a manager's credentials and both land on the
 * audit trail. Do not widen either to CASHIER to make this file look
 * consistent; the asymmetry is the feature.
 *
 * Middleware order is docs/CONVENTIONS.md section 8:
 * authenticate, tenant, permission, validate, controller.
 *
 * There is no DELETE here and there will not be one. A bill is voided, with a
 * reason and an actor, and its number stays spent.

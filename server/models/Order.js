/**
 * ONE LIVE ORDER PER TABLE. This index is the answer to the two waiters problem.
 *
 * It is partial, filtered to `occupiesTable: true` -- true for OCCUPYING_ORDER_
 * STATUSES (OPEN and READY_TO_BILL), false otherwise -- so a table can carry
 * any number of closed orders through its life and exactly one live one at a
 * time. Two waiters pressing "new order" on T1 in the same millisecond both
 * reach the database; one insert succeeds and the other comes back as a
 * duplicate key error, which orderController turns into 409 TABLE_OCCUPIED
 * carrying the winner's id, so the second waiter opens the first waiter's
 * order instead of a second one.
 *
 * READY_TO_BILL keeps a table occupied too, not just OPEN, because a table
 * whose food is all served is not free. The party is still sitting there,
 * unbilled, and a table that reads as free the moment the last dish goes out
 * is a table a waiter can double-book on top of a customer waiting for the
 * check.
 *
 * The filter is `occupiesTable: true`, not `status: { $in: OCCUPYING_ORDER_
 * STATUSES } }`, on purpose. partialFilterExpression only supports equality,
 * $exists, $gt/$gte/$lt/$lte, $type, and a top-level $and of those -- not $in.
 * MongoDB accepts an $in there without error, which makes the mistake very
 * easy to make and very quiet: the index looks exactly right in
 * `db.orders.getIndexes()` and enforces nothing, because nothing matches an
 * operator the partial filter cannot evaluate. `occupiesTable` exists so this
 * index has an equality condition to filter on; see the field's own comment
 * and the two hooks above it for how it stays in sync with `status`.
 *
 * `status` is deliberately NOT in the index key. It was in the key when the
 * filter was `status: { $in: [...] } }`, and moving to `occupiesTable` without
 * dropping it from the key would have kept today's bug alive in a new shape:
 * an OPEN order and a READY_TO_BILL order on the same table both have
 * `occupiesTable: true`, but they have different `status`, so a key of
 * (restaurantId, tableId, status) would treat them as two different keys and
 * let both exist. The key is (restaurantId, tableId) alone, so any two
 * documents on the same table that both match the partial filter collide,
 * regardless of which occupying status either one is in.
 *
 * The check-then-write version of this in application code is the race, not the
 * fix. Between the check and the write there is a gap, and on a Friday night
 * something will land in it. Do not replace this index with a findOne.

/**
 * GST arithmetic. All of it. Nothing outside this file computes tax.
 *
 * This is to tax what utils/money.js is to money, and for the same reason:
 * CONVENTIONS section 13 makes GST the one place where a quiet bug costs a
 * client money, so it gets one implementation and real tests.
 *
 * The rules, all decided in docs/PROJECT-STATE.md's decision log on 2026-08-30
 * and written up in docs/DB-SCHEMA.md section 12:
 *
 *   D1  Menu prices are tax-EXCLUSIVE. Tax is computed and added on top.
 *
 *   D2  Rounding happens ONCE PER RATE SLAB. Not per line, not on the bill
 *       total. Lines are grouped by taxRateBps, each group's taxable value is
 *       summed, and that group's tax is rounded once. Rounding each line and
 *       adding gives a different answer from adding and rounding once, and
 *       BUILD-PLAN section 8 names that as how a printed bill and a report end
 *       up a rupee apart. Per slab is chosen because that is exactly how a GST
 *       invoice prints.
 *
 *   D2a A bill-level discount reduces TAXABLE VALUE, so it is apportioned
 *       across slabs before tax is computed. It cannot simply come off the
 *       grand total, or the tax is overstated.
 *
 *   D3  Intra-state only. No IGST. Each slab splits in half and CGST takes the
 *       extra paisa when the total is odd.

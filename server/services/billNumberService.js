/**
 * Bill numbers. Sequential per restaurant, branch and financial year, and

 *
 * This exists as its own file rather than as another function in
 * counterService.js because the two have opposite guarantees, and putting them
 * side by side is how somebody eventually calls the wrong one.
 *
 * counterService.nextNumber reserves a number and lets the caller write the
 * document afterwards. If that write fails the number is spent and the sequence
 * has a hole. models/Counter.js says in as many words that this is fine for an
 * order or a kitchen ticket and not fine for a bill.
 *
 * So this reserves the number INSIDE the caller's transaction. Both the counter
 * increment and the bill insert commit together or neither does, and an aborted
 * insert rolls the counter back with it. That is the whole gap-free guarantee
 * and it is the reason a session is a required argument rather than an option.

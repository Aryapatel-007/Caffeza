/**
 * Building and checking the indexes every model declares.
 *
 * `autoIndex` is off in production (config/database.js), so a live server never
 * builds an index in the middle of service. That leaves nothing building them
 * at all, and on a fresh production database the unique indexes that stop a
 * duplicate bill number, a second open order on one table, a reused KOT number
 * and a double stock deduction would simply not exist. Every one of those
 * guards would be silently off.
 *
 * So indexes are built deliberately, by `npm run db:indexes` on every deploy,
 * and the production boot check in server.js refuses to start while one is
 * missing.
 *
 * This file NEVER drops an index. Not `syncIndexes`, which drops whatever the
 * schema does not mention, not `dropIndex`, not for any reason. An index the
 * schema does not declare is reported as extra and left exactly where it is:
 * someone may have built it by hand for a reason, and removing it is a
 * decision for a person, not a deploy script.

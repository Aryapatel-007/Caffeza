 * Who may do what to a bill, in one file.

 * route handlers.
 *
 * Two kinds of rule live here, and the split is the one M0-C established.
 *
 * Permission rules are about who the caller is and fail with 403 FORBIDDEN.
 * Business rules are about the state of the bill or the order and fail with
 * 422. 403 means "not you"; 422 means "not this, by anyone".
 *
 * The route table already refuses the wrong role before a controller runs, so
 * the assertions here are the second line rather than the only one. They exist
 * because a route table is a list of strings that can be edited without anyone
 * reading the reasoning, and the reasoning is what this file holds.

/**
 * Turning a finished order into a bill, and everything that happens to a bill
 * afterwards.
 *
 * Every business rule in M3 is either here or in billPermissionService.js.
 * Controllers read the request, call one of these, and send the answer.
 *
 * Three properties this file exists to hold:
 *
 * 1. A bill copies from the ORDER LINE, never from `menuitems`. The order line
 *    already copied name, price and tax rate when it was added. This file does
 *    not import the MenuItem model and must not start: the 7pm order bills at
 *    the 7pm price because the price travelled with the line, not because
 *    anything here looks it up.
 *
 * 2. Every figure comes from utils/tax.js. There is no arithmetic in this file
 *    beyond adding up payments, because two places that both work out a total
 *    eventually disagree by a rupee.
 *
 * 3. Creating a bill runs in a real transaction or not at all. The bill number
 *    is reserved inside it, so a failed insert burns no number.

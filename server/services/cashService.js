/**
 * The cash drawer. M16, built in P10. docs/API-CONTRACT.md "M16" sections 3
 * and 9.
 *
 * The opening float, top-ups (paid in), expenses (paid out), and from P29
 * cash taken out and cash checks. Each takes today's business date from the
 * service clock and nothing else. Voided, never deleted. Cash taken for bills
 * and cash collected on accounts are not here: they are payments and account
 * entries, and computeDayFigures adds them in.
 *
 * P29 Part F, the cash book. The flow reads like the owner's own drawing:
 * brought forward + top-ups + cash sales + cash collections - expenses - cash
 * taken out = cash in drawer. The blind count still works: the server leaves
 * the cash in the drawer and every difference out for anyone who may not see
 * them (seesDrawerTotal), never only hiding them on screen.

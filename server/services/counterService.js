/**
 * Handing out sequential numbers.
 *
 * One function, one operation, and the operation is the whole point: a single
 * atomic findOneAndUpdate. Never a read followed by a write.
 *
 * Read-then-write looks like this, and it is wrong:
 *
 *   const counter = await Counter.findOne({ ... });   // both waiters read 42
 *   counter.value += 1;                               // both compute 43
 *   await counter.save();                             // both write 43
 *
 * Two waiters pressing send in the same millisecond on a Friday both get order
 * number 43, and the unique index on orderNumber then rejects one of their
 * orders for a reason neither of them can act on. $inc does the read, the add
 * and the write inside the database, where nothing can interleave.
 */

/**
 * Reserves and returns the next number in a sequence.
 *
 * `upsert: true` means the counter creates itself the first time a restaurant
 * fires an order. There is no seeding step and provisioning does not know this
 * collection exists.
 *
 * The filter carries restaurantId, so the tenant guard is satisfied the
 * ordinary way. No escape hatch here, or anywhere else in M2.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT run inside the caller's transaction, even when there is one.
 * The number is reserved before the document that will carry it is written, so
 * a failed write leaves a gap rather than reusing a number. Gaps are acceptable
 * for orders and kitchen tickets and the reasoning is written out in full in
 * models/Counter.js. Bill numbers in M3 are a different problem.

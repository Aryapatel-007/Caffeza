/**

 * No controller reads `restaurant.settings` directly. Same discipline as no

 * when a setting moves, gains a default, or changes shape, one file changes.
 *
 * `restaurants` is the documented tenancy-root exception and carries neither
 * baseSchema nor tenantGuard, so every query here is by `_id` taken from a
 * verified token. That is legitimate unguarded pattern 1 from the note at the
 * top of models/Restaurant.js. This module needs no tenant-guard escape hatch
 * of any kind: `restaurants` has no guard to skip, and the audit writes go
 * through auditService, which is an ordinary scoped write. The production count
 * of that hatch is unchanged by M7, and there is a tripwire asserting it.
